# Github File Mover

The idea of the project is to move files from one place into a repo on Github. The project is built using Node.js and the Vercel platform.

What works:

Api - `getFolders.js` - This function retrieves a list of folders from a Github repository.

What doesnt work & Why

Api - `uploadFile.js` - This function is supposed to upload a file to a Github repository. However, it is not implemented yet. There either is not a current way to upload images to github via api, or it is unknown to me via the way I am currently using the api. 

IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO TRY TO UPLOAD IMAGES TO GITHUB VIA API, be my guest and let me know how. Thx :)
